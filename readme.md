Commands for Fibonacci numbers.

"fib" cannot handle very large numbers. Both "fibBig" and "gfib" can handle
arbitrary percision integers, but "fibBig" is faster.

"gfib" generates generalized fibonacci numbers. This means that it can generate
fibonacci numbers for various functions, and for arbitrary edge cases, and
arbitrarily many edge cases.
